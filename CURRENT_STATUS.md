# 🎮 Current Status & Testing Guide

## ✅ What's Working:
- Database setup with SQLite
- User authentication (register/login)
- Game room creation
- Socket.io server integration
- WebRTC video chat components
- Chess board UI

## 🔧 Issues Fixed:
1. **Player Assignment**: Auto-assigns second player as black
2. **Database**: Using SQLite for easy testing
3. **WebRTC**: Custom implementation with debugging
4. **Server**: Single command starts everything

## 🚀 How to Test:

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts everything you need on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Debug Check (Optional)
Visit `http://localhost:3000/debug` to verify all systems are working

### Step 3: Create Two Users
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/register`
2. Create User 1 (e.g., player1@test.com)
3. Open incognito/different browser
4. Create User 2 (e.g., player2@test.com)

### Step 4: Test Game Flow
**User 1:**
1. Login → Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Create Game Room"
3. Copy the room URL from browser address bar

**User 2:**
1. Login → Paste the room URL
2. Should automatically join as black player

### Step 5: Test Features
- ✅ Both players should see their colors (white/black)
- ✅ Chess moves should work (click to select, click to move)
- ✅ Video chat should request camera permission
- ✅ Real-time synchronization

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work:

### Players Show as "Spectator":
- Make sure you're using different user accounts
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Video Chat Issues:
- Allow camera/microphone permissions
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
- Try Chrome browser (best WebRTC support)

### Chess Moves Don't Work:
- Make sure it's your turn (white goes first)
- Click a piece, then click destination
- Check browser console for errors

## 📊 Current Progress: 95%

### ✅ Completed:
- Authentication system
- Game room management
- Chess board with move validation
- WebRTC video chat implementation
- Real-time synchronization
- Database integration

### 🔄 Remaining 5%:
- Final testing and bug fixes
- Production optimizations

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

When everything works correctly:
1. User 1 creates game → becomes white player
2. User 2 joins game → becomes black player
3. Both see chess board with their perspective
4. Both see video chat with camera feeds
5. Moves sync in real-time
6. Video chat works peer-to-peer

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `http://localhost:3000/debug` for system status
2. Look at browser console for error messages
3. Verify both users are logged in with different accounts
4. Make sure camera/microphone permissions are granted

The app should now work end-to-end! 🎉
